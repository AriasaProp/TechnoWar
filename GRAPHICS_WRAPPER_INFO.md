# Android Graphics Wrappers Overview & Recent Changes

This document provides an overview of the graphics wrapper layer in this project and summarizes the recent work completed.

## 1. Purpose of the Graphics Wrappers

This project uses a **graphics abstraction layer** to separate the main application logic from the low-level graphics rendering code. This is achieved through two key files:

-   `android/c/opengles_wrapper.c`: The implementation for the **OpenGL ES** rendering backend.
-   `android/c/vulkan_wrapper.c`: The implementation for the **Vulkan** rendering backend.

This design allows the application to switch between graphics APIs without changing the core application code. The wrappers are responsible for all API-specific tasks, including:

-   **Initialization and Shutdown**: Setting up the graphics context and cleaning up all resources when the application closes.
-   **Window Lifecycle**: Handling window creation, destruction, and resizing.
-   **Resource Management**: Creating and destroying graphics resources like textures, meshes, and shaders.
-   **Rendering**: Executing the API-specific commands to draw each frame.

## 2. Summary of Recent Changes

Here is a summary of the work I have completed to finalize the graphics layer:

### `opengles_wrapper.c`

This file was already mostly functional. I made one minor improvement:

-   **Improved EGL Configuration**: Addressed a `TODO` in the code to make the EGL config selection more robust by having it consider multisampling (`EGL_SAMPLES`). This can lead to better anti-aliasing and visual quality.

### `vulkan_wrapper.c`

This file was previously a skeleton and has now been fully implemented.

-   **Full Implementation**: The wrapper now contains a complete, robust Vulkan renderer. The logic was migrated from the now-deleted `VulkanMain.cpp` and adapted to a pure C implementation.
-   **Resumable Initialization**: The initialization code in `vulkan_preRender` is now **state-driven and resumable**. If a step fails (e.g., due to a temporary driver issue), it will be safely retried on the next frame without crashing the application. This makes the renderer much more stable.
-   **Complete Lifecycle Management**: The wrapper now correctly handles all window events, including creation, destruction, and resizing. The Vulkan swapchain and its dependent resources are now properly recreated when the window changes.
-   **Robust Resource Cleanup**: `vulkan_term` and other cleanup functions are fully implemented to release all Vulkan resources, preventing memory and resource leaks.

### Shader Compilation

The Vulkan renderer requires shaders in the **SPIR-V** format. The original shaders were in GLSL.

-   **Installed `glslang`**: I installed the `glslang` package, which provides the `glslangValidator` tool.
-   **Compiled Shaders**: I used `glslangValidator` to compile the existing `tri.vert` and `tri.frag` shaders into `tri.vert.spv` and `tri.frag.spv`. These new SPIR-V files are now used by the Vulkan wrapper.
